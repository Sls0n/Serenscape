## Takeaways

This project served as an invaluable learning experience for me. Over the course of about a month, I was able to complete it, though not without some unexpected challenges along the way. Prior to this, I had only built a simple to-do app, so I went into this project knowing it would be an ambitious undertaking. The skills I thoroughly developed during this time include:

â€¢React hooks, context API, React Router, React Hook Form, React-Query, Redux-toolkit, Firebase, Authentication, Audio API, Framer Motion, and more.

Though at times arduous, this project was extremely rewarding in my opinion. Building this webapp has given me a solid foundation of knowledge and skills to leverage for future projects.
